<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Shahin, and I have completed my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering. During my academic journey, I developed a strong interest in software development and emerging technologies. I’ve always been passionate about problem-solving and using technology to create practical solutions, which guided many of my academic and personal projects.</p>

<p>
As part of my final year, I developed an Android application for an agricultural product distribution system. This project gave me hands-on experience in mobile app development, user interface design, and understanding how technology can improve real-world processes like supply chains in agriculture. I also completed an internship in Artificial Intelligence, where I explored concepts such as machine learning and data analysis. Through these experiences, I’ve gained skills in Java, Android Studio, Python, and working with AI tools and frameworks.

I’m now looking to begin my professional career where I can apply my technical knowledge and continue learning. I’m particularly interested in roles that allow me to work on innovative software solutions and grow in areas like app development and AI. I’m a fast learner, a team player, and highly motivated to contribute to meaningful projects. I’m excited about the opportunity to bring my skills and enthusiasm to your team and make a positive impact.
